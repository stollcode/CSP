"""
python Lists and Loops
======================

Directions
----------
Create a document named lists_and_loops1.py and save it in your z:\CSP folder.


1) - Use the range() command to create a list named myNumbers, containing numbers
        between 1 and 50
   - Loop through the list and print each number on a separate line.
"""




"""
2) Create a list named myGrades using the following values:
        88, 91, 57, 36, 93, 83, 74, 32
"""




"""
3) Use a for loop to sum the values in myGrades.
"""




"""
4) Use a for loop to print the highest value from the myGrades list.
"""




"""
5) Use a while loop to print the average value from the myGrades list.
"""




"""
6) Create a list named studentNames using the following names:
        "Pete", "Joseph", "Stephen", "Wyatt", "Drew", "elijah"
"""




"""
7) Use a while loop to print the name from the studentNames list with the
        most characters.
"""




"""
8) Use the in operator to determine if studentNames contains the name "Drew".
        Print "Drew is in the list" if his name is in the studentNames list.
"""




"""
9) Create a string named movies using the following code:
        movie = "The Saga of the Viking Women and their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent"
"""




"""
10) Use the in operator to see if the movie variable contains the word "Viking".  The
    output should look like:

        movie contains Viking: True
"""




"""
11) Use the in operator to see if the movie variable contains the word "men". The output
    should look like:

        movie contains men: True
"""




"""
12) Use the in operator to see if the movie variable contains the word "Men". The output
    should look like:

        movie contains Men: False
"""




"""
13) Create a tuple (not a list) named   grades   containing the following values:
    88, 55, 26, 98, 90, 87
"""




"""
14) Set the fourth value from 98 to 89 and print the   grades   tuple.
"""




"""
15) Create a 2d list named armorList. The first column must contain the armor name,
    The second column must contain attack speed and the third column must contain
    damage.
"""




"""
16) Use a nested for loop to print the armorList using column headings.
