  c) If mpg is 32 or greater:
        Fuel effeciency: value_of_mpg_variable MPG. Awesome!
     If below 32 mpg print the following message

    - Print "Begin Countdown!!!" if it is launchReady and has a fuelAmount > 4000.0
    - Print detailed error message for each of the following conditions:
        - It is launchReady but does not have enough fuel.
        - It has enough fuel but is not launchReady.
        - It does not have enough fuel and is not launchReady
3) Call the launch() function passing in the appropriate values.
4) Call the launch() function four times to test each of possible conditions.
