"""
** The Car class **
	1. Define a class that represents a car. This class should have three
        attributes, four methods and a constructor:
	   Attributes:
        - age
        - model
        - isRunning
	   Methods
    	- startEngine() that, when called, sets the isRunning to True.
    	- stopEngine() that, when called, sets the isRunning to False.
        - getModel()    #Returns the model attribute of the car
        - setModel()    #Sets the model attribute of the car
        - For the sake of berevity, we are not creating getters and
                setters for age.
    2. Create a constructor that accepts the values for age and model and
        set the appropriate property.
	3. Create an instance of Car.  It is a three year old Chevy that is
        not running.
    4. Start the engine
    5. Print the attributes of your car object (use the getter for
        the model attribute)
** The Shape class **
	1. Define a class that represents a Shape. This class will have two
            attributes, a method, and a constructor:
	   Attributes:
            - x     position of the shape on the screen.
            - y     position of the shape on the screen.
        Methods:
            - setX(); getX(); setY(); getY() (getters and setters).
        Constructor:
            The constructor must set the values of the attributes mentioned
            above based on values passed into the constructor upon
            object creation.
    2. Test your code by creating an instance of the class and calling the
            methods that change the values of the attributes.
    3. Print the values of your attributes as the last part of the test using
        your getters to get the values.
**The Circle Class **
	1. Define a class that represents a Circle. It MUST INHERIT THE ATTRIBUTES and
            METHODS OF THE Shape CLASS. This class will contain one attribute, one
            method, and one constructor:
	   Attributes:
	       - Radius
       Method:
	       - calcArea()
	           - Use the formula A= πr^2 and make π equal to 3.14
	           - Return the value from the method.
        Constructor:
        The constructor must accept radius attribute as a parameter and sets the
            attribute.
    2. Test your code by:
        a. creating an instance of the class and calling the calcArea()
            method.
        b. Set the x and y coordinates to 10 and 50 using the appropriate setter methods.
        c. Print the value returned by the calcArea() method.
        d. Print the x, y coordinates of your circle using the getX and getY getter methods.
** Questions **
	1. In the example above, Circle inherits from Shape which makes Shape
        the _____________________   and Circle the ____________________.
        (Note: Parent and child will not be good enough.  I need the official terms.)
	2. Software developers often use UML diagrams to describe their ideas during the
        early stages of software development. Suppose you and your partner are working
        on a word processing program.
	3. Describe what you would want the user to be able to do with the word processing software.
        b.	Identify all nouns in the above description.
        c.	List the entities for each noun that you think would make sense as a class.
            Identify the entity names, attributes, and methods.
